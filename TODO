why does viscacha not update after ack
put locks on any other vars
is servo_change used any more? (does the servo ever set values on redis?)

other possible model:
local dictionary synched to redis variables; commands to handler stacks on device threads
linkage of systems to variables specified at run-time, read from YAML/JSON file

changes for AMCP:
new category for destination within amcp
mutex locking in control.c for parameter values
IMPORTANT: cmdindex >= 0 NOT >0 in ctrl_cmd_param, prevented command 0 from being recognized
clean up anything not needed in the json (cmdnum?)
