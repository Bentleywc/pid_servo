structure:
the servo thread pushes its values to a circular buffer and pulls the current FIR value (at lower rate than push?)
one block in YAML per servo: PID, sat, mem, active, channel, name, desc, default values

parse the YAML servo specification file: initialize circular buffers, filter coefficients, name, etc.
implement redis thread that pushes sub values to a PID param dict
have servo thread pull filtered values, write those with timestamps
implement FIR; coefs read from file
compare in kst: is the servo seeing reasonable inputs?
implement the servo driver
thermal mass thread?
redis thread to accept commands
