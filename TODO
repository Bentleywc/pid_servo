structure:
the servo thread pushes its values to a circular buffer and pulls the current FIR value (at lower rate than push?)
one block in YAML per servo: PID, sat, mem, active, channel, name, desc, default values

initialize one circular buffer for each servo
write the measured temperature with timestamp to file
have servo thread pull filterd values, write those with timestamps
implement FIR; coefs read from file
compare in kst: is the servo seeing reasonable inputs?
implement the servo driver
thermal mass thread?
redis thread to accept commands
