put locks on any other vars
is servo_change used any more? (does the servo ever set values on redis?)

other possible model:
local dictionary synched to redis variables; commands to handler stacks on device threads
linkage of systems to variables specified at run-time, read from YAML/JSON file

changes for AMCP:
mutex locking in control.c for parameter values
